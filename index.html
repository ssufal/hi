  <h1> History of my pet cats. </h1>
    <img src="images/cat-47495_960_720.png." alt="A mewing cat.">
	<p> I had several cats. I adopted my first cat when I was 7 years old. It was very adorable cat. I named him mini. My most recent cats were
a male cat named "Sada biral" and a female cat named "Kalo biral". I left them in my home when came to Sweden from Bangladesh in 2010. </p>
	<p> We used to feed them the following foods: </p>
	<ol> 
	<li> Cooked rice</li>
	<li> Some small fishes </li>
	<li> Curry </li>
	<li> Water</li>
	</ol>
	<p> Some times I feed them medicine to kill their worms paracites infection. </p>
